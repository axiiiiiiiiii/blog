# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2026-01-20

Welcome t my _new blog_ about learning to use the Astro framework.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, i created a new Astro project using npm create astro@lastest, then i created my index, about an blog pages and made buttons to link them all toghether.

2. **Connecting Online Services**: I connected my VSCode to github, published my project to a Github repository, then connnected Netlify to my Github account and let Netlify build and deploy the website.

3. **Making My First Blog Post** Thats what your reading right now, my first blog post on my website, i created it using a Markdown file.

## What's Next?

I will continue working on my website and add more posts as a progress.
